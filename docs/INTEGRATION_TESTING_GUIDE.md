# ðŸ§ª Integration Testing Guide

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Purpose:** Step-by-step guide to test backend integration

---

## Prerequisites

### 1. Environment Setup

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct backend URL:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
# Or for production/staging:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
```

### 2. Backend Server Running

Ensure your backend server is running and accessible:

```bash
# Test backend connection
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
# or
curl https://your-backend-api.com/api/health
```

### 3. Start Frontend Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### âœ… Test 2: Avatar Upload - Valid Image

**Steps:**
1. Go to Profile page (logged in)
2. Click "Choose File" button
3. Select a valid image:
   - Format: JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP
   - Size: < 5MB
4. Confirm file selection
5. Click "Save" button

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Preview shows immediately after file selection

- âœ… File is not uploaded
- âœ… No network request sent

---

### âœ… Test 5: Profile Update - Validation Errors

**Steps:**

### âœ… Test 6: Portfolio Statistics

**Steps:**
1. Login to account
2. Navigate to Profile page
3. Check portfolio statistics section

**Current Behavior:**

**Optional Enhancement (to implement):**
```jsx
// Add to ProfilePage.jsx useEffect:
const { fetchPortfolioStats, portfolioStats } = usePortfolioStore();

useEffect(() => {
  fetchPortfolioStats();
}, []);

// Use portfolioStats instead of calculating:
const totalProjects = portfolioStats?.totalPortfolios || 0;
const publishedProjects = portfolioStats?.publishedPortfolios || 0;
```

## Browser DevTools Checklist

### Network Tab

Check these requests are working:

- [ ] `GET /api/users/profile` - Get current user
- [ ] `PATCH /api/users/profile` - Update profile
- [ ] `POST /api/users/avatar` - Upload avatar
- [ ] `GET /api/portfolios/user/me` - Get portfolios
- [ ] `GET /api/portfolios/stats` - Get stats (optional)

### Console Tab

Look for:
- [ ] No JavaScript errors
- [ ] No 401/403/404 errors (unless expected)
- [ ] Proper success messages
- [ ] Debug logs showing correct flow

### Application Tab > Local Storage

Verify:
- [ ] `aurea_token` is stored
- [ ] `aurea_user` is stored and updated
- [ ] User avatar URL updates after upload

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: 401 Unauthorized on all requests

**Cause:** Token missing or expired

**Solution:**
1. Check localStorage for `aurea_token`
2. Try logging out and back in
3. Verify backend JWT_SECRET matches

### Issue: CORS errors

**Cause:** Backend CORS not configured for frontend URL

**Solution:**
1. Add frontend URL to backend CORS whitelist
2. Check `FRONTEND_URL` in backend .env
3. Restart backend server

### Issue: Avatar upload returns 413

**Cause:** File too large or backend limit exceeded

**Solution:**
1. Verify file is < 5MB
2. Check backend MAX_FILE_SIZE setting
3. Compress image before uploading

### Issue: Validation errors not displaying

**Cause:** Response format mismatch

**Solution:**
1. Check backend returns `details` object
2. Verify error structure matches:
   ```json
   {
     "success": false,
     "error": "Validation failed",
     "details": {
       "fieldName": "Error message"
     }
   }
   ```

### Issue: Avatar preview not updating

**Cause:** State not synchronized

**Solution:**
1. Check user state is updated after upload
2. Verify `user.avatar` field is populated
3. Check localStorage is updated

---

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing

Test with multiple users:
- 10 concurrent profile updates
- 5 concurrent avatar uploads
- Check response times stay < 2 seconds

### File Upload Testing

Test various file sizes:
- 100KB - should be instant
- 1MB - should complete in 1-2 seconds
- 5MB - should complete in 3-5 seconds

---

## Security Testing

### Authorization Testing

- [ ] Try to update another user's profile (should fail)
- [ ] Try API without token (should return 401)
- [ ] Try with expired token (should return 401)

### Input Validation

- [ ] Try SQL injection in username
- [ ] Try XSS in firstName/lastName
- [ ] Try invalid email formats
- [ ] Try extremely long strings

### File Upload Security

- [ ] Try uploading executable files
- [ ] Try uploading files with malicious content
- [ ] Try oversized files
- [ ] Verify uploaded files are scanned

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to production URL
- [ ] Test all scenarios on staging
- [ ] Verify Cloudinary credentials are correct
- [ ] Check rate limiting is configured
