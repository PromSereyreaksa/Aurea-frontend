Files Modified:
- src/components/LandingPage/ModernHero.jsx
- src/components/LandingPage/FeaturesGrid.jsx
- src/components/LandingPage/HowItWorks.jsx
- src/index.css

Breaking Changes: None
Backward Compatible: Yes

Testing:
- Chrome DevTools Performance profiling
- CPU 4x throttling test
- Mobile device testing (Android/iOS)
- Accessibility testing (prefers-reduced-motion)

Documentation:
- Complete technical guide in ANIMATION_OPTIMIZATION.md
- Quick reference in ANIMATION_QUICK_REFERENCE.md
