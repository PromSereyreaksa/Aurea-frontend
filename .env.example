# === IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE ===
# Environment variables prefixed with VITE_ are bundled into the client JavaScript
# and are PUBLICLY VISIBLE in the browser. NEVER store secrets here.
#
# Rules:
# - Backend URLs: OK (they're already public as URLs)
# - Public configuration: OK
# - API Keys, Tokens, Credentials: NOT OK - Must be handled server-side only
#
# If you need to use external services with API keys:
# 1. Call your backend instead: fetch('/api/someService')
# 2. Your backend has the API key in its private .env
# 3. Backend communicates with external service securely

# API Configuration
# This is your backend URL - it's OK to have this as VITE_ because it's not a secret
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
VITE_API_TIMEOUT=10000

# Environment
VITE_NODE_ENV=development
